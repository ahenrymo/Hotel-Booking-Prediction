# Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction

This project focuses on predicting hotel booking cancellations using various machine learning techniques. The dataset used includes several features related to hotel bookings. The primary goal is to develop models that can accurately predict whether a booking will be canceled.

## Dataset

The dataset contains information about hotel bookings and includes features like lead time, arrival date, length of stay, number of guests, room type, and several others.

## Structure of the Repository

- `hotel-booking-prediction-99-5-acc.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the detailed analysis and modeling.

## Installation and Usage

To run the notebook:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install required dependencies:
3. Open the Jupyter notebook:jupyter notebook hotel-booking-prediction-99-5-acc.ipynb


## Methodology

The project is divided into several sections:

1. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the data, handling missing values, and feature engineering.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyzing the dataset to understand the distribution and relation of various features.
3. **Model Building**: Various models like Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Trees, Random Forest, AdaBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, CatBoost, Extra Trees, LGBM, and ANN are implemented and evaluated.
4. **Model Evaluation**: Comparison of different models based on their accuracy scores.

## Results

The project successfully develops multiple machine learning models with the highest accuracy achieved being 99.5% using the CatBoost classifier.

## Contributing

Contributions, issues, and feature requests are welcome.
